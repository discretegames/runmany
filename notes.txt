Trying to think up a good separator for .many files that never appears in any language's syntax.

According to https://www.wired.com/2013/08/the-rarity-of-the-ampersand/
*Character Frequency*: SPC e t a o i n s r h l d c u m f g p y w ENT b , . v k - " _ ' x ) ( ; 0 &nbsp;j 1 q = 2 : z / * ! ? $ 3 5 > { } 4 9 [ ] 8 6 7  + | & < % @ # ^ ` ~
*Punctuation Frequency*: , . - " _ ' ) ( ; = : / * ! ? $ > { } [ ]  + | & < % @ # ^ ` ~

so `~^@# seem good candidates

~~~ feels to simple, a language that uses ~ as a comment might have ~~~THING~~~ in it


~!@ appears here https://github.com/ICGog/MapReduce-Thorn/blob/master/lib/fisher/testcase/eval/071-json/071a.th
~!@eq(jsonParse('"\\u0041"'), 'A')@!~  ;

a few languages use @ or ~ for comments https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Comments

@~~ seems like it'd work, "spring" operator
@~~NAME~~@

using chars forbidden in filenames might be a good idea
on Linux that's just /
on windows there's way more but stick to /

\@/NAME\@/ yay operators
look worse and harder to type

also a good idea to start it with a character that doesn't usually start lines
so none of / # @

maybe then
~~| PYTHON |~~
~~~| PYTHON |~~~
~~~| py |~~~

I like "~~~| " on both sides since it looks nice and adds 10 chars to the line, nice even number
no real google github search results for it, good

think I want to be lenient with case and abbreviations
py PYTHON PY python Python all fine

but also is ~ on most keyboards? https://superuser.com/questions/667622/italian-keyboard-entering-tilde-and-backtick-characters-without-changin

ยง could be another option but ehh, way too hard to type
