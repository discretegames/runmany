# RunMany


Tool to run many programs written in many languages from one file.

Readme is just a todo list for now.

## TODO

- see if I can get runmany PyPI name back https://github.com/pypa/pypi-support/issues/1278
- Turn into a pip package. "pip install runmany" then "runmany example.many".
  - Make sure correct path to default_language.json is used in pip version.
- Automated testing with tox
- Docstrings.
- A vscode plugin for syntax highlighting and running .many files?
