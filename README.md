# RunMany

A way to run many programming languages in one file.

Readme is just a todo list for now.

## TODO

Soon:

- Command line runnable with input+output+json file options.

- Option to check for stdout equality. Display success at the end and differing ones.

- Add $argv to all json commands and test

- should xxx|xxx seps be ignored when their header is correct type but commented? kinda probably

- Turn into a pip package. "pip install runmany" then "runmany example.many".
  - Make sure correct path to language.json is used in pip version.

- update c# csc compiler 4.8? roslyn?

Less Soon:

- Docstrings.
- Automated testing.
- A vscode plugin for syntax highlighting and running .many files??
