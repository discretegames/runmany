# RunMany

A way to run many programming languages in one file.

Readme is just a todo list for now.

## TODO

Soon:

- Add $argv to all json commands and test

- inherit default languages option (remove backup?)

- make silent into show_errors and add show argv, show_stdin, show_output - yes - more consistent

- Turn into a pip package. "pip install runmany" then "runmany example.many".
  - Make sure correct path to language.json is used in pip version.
- Option to check for stdout equality. Display success at the end and differing ones. ?

Less Soon:

- Docstrings.
- Automated testing.
- A vscode plugin for syntax highlighting and running .many files??
- update c# csc compiler 4.8? roslyn?
