# RunMany

A tool to run many programs written in many languages from one file.

```console
pip install run-many
```

then

```console
runmany myfile.many
```

or, in Python

```py
from run_many import runmany
runmany('myfile.many')
```  

See [the examples](https://github.com/discretegames/runmany/tree/main/examples) for some file to try.

This readme is mostly a todo list for now.

## TODO

- Readme with examples, .many syntax spec, etc.
- A vscode plugin for syntax highlighting and running .many files?
