# RunMany

A way to run many programming languages in one file.

Readme is just a todo list for now.

## TODO

Soon:

- Turn into a pip package. "pip install runmany" then "runmany example.many".
  - Make sure correct path to language.json is used in pip version.

- Option to check for stdout equality. Display success at the end and differing ones. ?

Less Soon:

- Docstrings.
- Automated testing.
- A vscode plugin for syntax highlighting and running .many files??
